TUTORIAL.1.A,,"Your settlers have three basic needs to fulfil: food, drink and somewhere to sleep. Although they will complain about it for now, they can drink from the nearby river and sleep on the ground. What they can’t do is magic up some food from nowhere (at least, not without a mage around!) so we will focus on food to begin with.",
TUTORIAL.1.B,,"The first thing you should do each spring is ensure that enough crops have been planted for the harvest in autumn. Farming is a reliable and sustainable food source, but you need to make sure you have enough crops to feed your population between each annual harvest.",
TUTORIAL.1.C,,"A good rule of thumb to follow is to ensure you have 10 tiles of crops being sown for each settler in your population. Currently there are 7 settlers milling around, so go ahead and click “{{GUI.ZONES_LABEL}}” > “{{ROOMS.FARM}}”, and designate / drag out several farm plots on a grassy area.",
TUTORIAL.2.A,,"With nothing else to do, your settlers will start preparing these {{ROOMS.FARM.PLURAL}} by tilling the earth to be ready for seeds to be sown. This doesn’t require any special tools or knowledge so everyone should get involved.",
TUTORIAL.2.B,,"This prepares the plot to be sown, but you need to select which crop to grow on each farm plot before a farmer will come and plant the relevant seeds. Your settlers have brought with them a selection of different seeds. You can click “Resources” in the upper-right to get a breakdown of all the items in your settlement.",
TUTORIAL.2.C,,"For the seeds to actually be available to your farmers, they need to be in a stockpile compared to being held in a dwarf’s inventory like they are currently.
